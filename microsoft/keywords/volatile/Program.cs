    With the volatile modifier added to the declaration of _shouldStop in place, you'll always get the same results 
    (similar to the excerpt shown in the preceding code). 
    However, without that modifier on the _shouldStop member, the behavior is unpredictable. 
    The DoWork method may optimize the member access, resulting in reading stale data. 
    Because of the nature of multi-threaded programming, the number of stale reads is unpredictable. 
    Different runs of the program will produce somewhat different results.
